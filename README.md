# Physics-Engine
A project designed towards teaching students how physics impact the games they play. Physics concepts are taught alongside programming applications to show how the concepts actually influence the controls within the game. These concepts include linear movement, rotation, momentum and impact collisions, applied forces, etc. These are then integrated in to hitbox creation and detection of objects. Collision detection becomes the primary focus after demonstrating transformation, rotation, and object creation principles. The collision detection ranges from simple AABB to BV Spheres. Quad tree data structures are used to provide visual examples of occupied space by individual shapes in order to show overlap between spatial points when multiple objects are present.
